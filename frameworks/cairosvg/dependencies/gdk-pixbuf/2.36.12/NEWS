* To improve the situation for language bindings, pixbufs can now
  be constructed from data in GBytes, and pixbuf data can also be
  extracted in this form. The GBytes data is treated as readonly,
  and gdk_pixbuf_get_pixels() will create a copy. To avoid this
  copy, a new function gdk_pixbuf_read_pixels() was introduced
  which returns a const pointer to the data without copying.

gdk-pixbuf has been turned back into a standalone library, after being
shipped as part of GTK+ for a number of years. The changes in this
version, compared to the version included in GTK+ 2.20 are the following:

* The default location for loaders has been changed to
  $libdir/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders

* The default location for the module file has been changed to
  $libdir/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders.cache
  and gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders-2.0 will update that file when given
  the --update-cache option.
