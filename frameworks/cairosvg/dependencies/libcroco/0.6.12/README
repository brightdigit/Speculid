What is The Croco Project ?
------------------------------

Libcroco is a standalone css2 parsing and manipulation library.
The parser provides a low level event driven SAC like api
and a css object model like api.
Libcroco provides a CSS2 selection engine and an experimental
xml/css rendering engine.

This library is being written to bring the css support
to the mlview xml editor project but it can be used
for other applications as well.
