Speculid is a macOS application for developers.
For developers in the Apple space, Xcode (the main developer application) requires particular file types and sizes for each image used. Whether the developer's app is for iPad, iPhone, Mac, or the Apple Watch. Speculid can take a single SVG or PNG file and resize the file according to the sizes required for that app.
For instance, if you are building a _universal app_ for all of Apple's operating system (macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and CarPlay) that would require 41 separately sized png graphic files. With Speculid, you can take one SVG file and automatically generate each png file on build.
Developers can use Speculid for each time a graphic is updated. Additionally, they can trim their code repository of unneeded graphic files and just make Speculid part of the Continous Integration environment.
